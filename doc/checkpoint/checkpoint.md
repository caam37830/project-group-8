A variation we would like to implement is to account for reinfection in the S, I, R model. With some viruses, even if infection leads to immunity in most, there is some probability of reinfection. Preliminary studies have found this to be the possible with coronavirus. 
1.	In the final report, we would like to show how reinfection influences the spread of the infection. This would include the size of infected population and the rate at which the infection spreads. 
2.	Implementing this from an ODE perspective, this would mean including in the rate of change of susceptible population a term connected with the recovered population’s probability of reinfection. This would also include accounting for recovered person’s who became infected again in the representation of the recovered population.
3.	If we want to model this as the coronavirus, limited information about reinfection rates can be found in a paper by Murillo-Zamora et al.
