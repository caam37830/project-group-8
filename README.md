## Overview of this Repository

This repository has a lot more than just the `sir` module. Some points of interest:

* See `sir` for agent based class and ODE based class, and classes for our extensions.
* See `test` for unit tests for model classes.
* See `Scripts` for proccess simulations and plots.
* See [`doc/final/final_report_team8.pdf`](https://github.com/caam37830/project-group-8/blob/main/doc/final/final_report_team8.pdf) for our final written report. The `TeX` source code is also available in this folder, in the subdirectory `final_tex`. It can be compiled using `pdflatex`; be sure to invoke `--shell-escape` if you want to compile it from source yourself.
* See `doc/checkpoint` for our preliminary findings, discussing of next steps (extensions and spatial implementation), and basic explanation of the SIR model. 

We use [`psf/black`](https://github.com/psf/black) as a linter on all `*.py` files in this project to maintain consistent code style. You can read about its opinions [here](https://github.com/psf/black#the-black-code-style).
